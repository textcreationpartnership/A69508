            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53932:9"/>which, the reducing of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath ≈øtill beene a chiefe part of the care of this Parliament, And God hath beene plea≈øed to ble≈ø≈øe our endeavours with ≈øuch ≈øucce≈ø≈øe as that tho≈øe furious bloud, thir≈øty <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> have beene in the carrier of their crueltie, ≈øome part of the <hi>Protestant</hi> bloud which at fir≈øt was ≈øpilt like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the ground hath beene revenged, their ma≈ø≈øacres, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and fami≈øhings, have by a divine retaliation beene repayde into their bo≈øome; And the <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> party hath been erected to that condition of ≈øtrenght and hope, that their enemies are con≈øtrayned (di≈øtru≈øting their forces) to have recour≈øe to their craft &amp; policies, and therefore by their ≈øubtill Agents at Court, and their active in≈øtruments el≈øewhere, have beene endeavoring now of along time to make our Armies in <hi>Ireland</hi> di≈øaffected to the Parliament, what by occa≈øion of their wants not ≈øo readily ≈øupplyed as their neede required, what by mi≈øu≈øing them with the≈øe unhappy differences fallen in here betweene <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>People,</hi> labouring by that meanes to devide tho≈øe forces into factions, to the end the maine worke they have in hand might be neglected, which is the pro≈øecution of the warre again≈øt the Rebels, &amp; ≈øo far brought low in ≈øome partes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that if they can bee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the benefit of this Harve≈øt, they are not likely to ≈øee the next Summer. And therefore the Rebels finding that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the di≈øtractions here occa≈øioning the ≈ølowne≈ø≈øe &amp; ≈øcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of ≈øupplyes, yet they them≈øelves are in a farre wor≈øe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being in want of mo≈øt things nece≈ø≈øary, not onely for the maintayning of a warre, but even of life the judgement of God being remarkeable upon them in this, that as their bloudy and treacherous Religion made them inhumanely cruell in ≈øhedding the prote≈øtants bloud, ≈øo now the famine among≈øt many of them hath made them unnaturally, and Canniball-like eate and feede one upon another. Therefore that they may have time to expect from their friends abroad new ≈øupplyes both of victuals and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and may without mole≈øtation reape the fruite of this harve≈øt, they have laboured a treaty for a Ce≈ø≈øation, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of theirs doth no le≈ø≈øe ayme at the overthrow of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Prote≈øtants in that kingdome then their treacherous ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Armes at the fir≈øt did intend the de≈øtruction of them all; for their Ce≈ø≈øation and ho≈øtility, their warre and peace are alike
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53932:10"/>to be e≈øteemed of, and with tho≈øe that neyther in peace nor warre keepe any faith, it is be≈øt to be in perpetuall defiance: Therefore the Lords and Commons in Parliament a≈ø≈øembled according to their continued care of that kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> doe in a ≈øpeciall manner take into their con≈øideration the condition thereof upon this occa≈øion of an intended Ce≈ø≈øation, and ≈øo much the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is feared that the <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> forces through want of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion for their Armies, may at la≈øt, if not relieved be per≈øwaded to admit of this cour≈øe in hope thereby to procure ≈øome meanes for their ≈øub≈øi≈øting, as al≈øo becau≈øe there is too much ground to ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect, that if this Ce≈ø≈øation ≈øhould be agreed unto, they might have opportunitie to joyne with the <hi>papi≈øt</hi> party heere for their greater ≈øtrenghtning. And though it were to have no influence upon this kingdome, yet the evill con≈øequences of it are ≈øo many and pernicious to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that this Parliament ≈øhould betray the tru≈øt repo≈øed in them, if they did not declare again≈øt this Ce≈ø≈øati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and u≈øe all meanes in time to make it prove abortive, And therefore they de≈øire that it may be ob≈øerved and taken notice of.</p>

And ≈øeeing that this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did with mo≈øt generous and Chri≈øtian re≈øolutions under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the charges of warre for the reliefe and recovery of <hi>Ireland,</hi> propo≈øitions were brought from the Rebellion the <hi>Lords Dillon</hi> &amp; <hi>Taffe</hi> at which time they were intercepted. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> re≈øtrayned by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the hou≈øe of Commons: After that, they had the boldne≈ø≈øe even while their hands were ≈øtill imbrued in the <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> bloud to petition to his Maje≈øtie that their demands might be heard, and for this purpo≈øe they obtayned a Commi≈ø≈øion to be ≈øent over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland</hi> to divers per≈øons of quality (whereof ≈øome were <hi>Papi≈øts</hi>) to heare, receive, &amp; tran≈ømit to his Maje≈øty their demands which was done accordingly, and one Ma≈øter <hi>Bourke,</hi> a notorious prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke <hi>Irish papist,</hi> was the chiefe ≈øollicitor in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, after this, the ju≈øt revenging God giving daily ≈øucce≈ø≈øe to the handfull of the <hi>Protestant</hi> forces, again≈øt their great numbers, ≈øo that by a wonderfull ble≈ø≈øing from heaven they were in mo≈øt parts put to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53932:10"/>the wor≈øt. Then did they begin to ≈øet on foote an overtime for a Ce≈ø≈øation of Armes, concerning which, what going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hath beene between the Court and the Rebels is very well knowne, and what meetings and treaties have beene held about it in <hi>Ireland</hi> by warrant of his Maje≈øties ample Commi≈ø≈øion ≈øent to that effect; and what reception and countenance mo≈øt pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke <hi>Papists</hi> negotiating the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe &amp; found at Court, and that tho≈øe of the State in <hi>Dublin</hi> who had ≈øo much Religion, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øty as to di≈ø≈øwade the Ce≈ø≈øation were fir≈øt di≈øcountenanced and at la≈øt put out of their places, and re≈øtrayned to pri≈øon, as <hi>Sir VVi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lliam Par≈øons</hi> one of the Lords ≈øu≈øtices there, <hi>Sir Iohn Temple</hi> Ma≈øter of the <hi>Rolles, Sir Adam Loftus</hi> Trea≈øurer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Trea≈øurer at warres, and <hi>Sir Robert Meredith</hi> one al≈øo of the Councell-Table.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Lords and Commons de≈øire it may be ob≈øerved that during all the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages and negotiations the hou≈øes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were never acquainted by the ≈øtate of <hi>Ireland</hi> with the treaty of a Ce≈ø≈øation, much le≈ø≈øe was their advi≈øe or Coun≈øell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, notwith≈øtanding that the care, and managing of the war was devolved on them both by Act of Parliament, and by his Maje≈øties Commi≈ø≈øion under the great Seale, to advi≈øe, order, and di≈øpo≈øe of all things concerning the government, and defence of that kingdome, but the wants of the Army were often repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and complayned of, whereby with much craft a ground was preparing for the pretext, wherewith now they would cover the Coun≈øell of this Ce≈ø≈øation, as if nothing had drawne it on, but the extreame wants of their Armies, whereas it is evident, that the report of ≈øuch a treaty have beene (in a great part) the cau≈øe of their wants, for thereby the adventurers were di≈øheartned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions were ≈øtopped, and by the admittance to Court of the negotiators of this Ce≈ø≈øation: their wicked Councell have had that influence, as to procure the intercepting of much provi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were ≈øent for <hi>Ireland,</hi> ≈øo that Ships going for <hi>Ireland</hi> with victuals, and others comming from thence with commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to exchange for victuals, have beene taken by <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Maje≈øties warrant, but al≈øo by <hi>English</hi> Ships commanded by <hi>Sir Iohn Pennigton</hi> under his Maje≈øty. And moreover the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament me≈ø≈øengers ≈øent into ≈øeverall Counties with the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Ianuary</hi> la≈øt for Ioanes, and contributions, have beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53932:11"/>and impri≈øoned, their Money taken from them, and not one penny eyther loane or contribution hath been ≈øuffered to be ≈øent in for <hi>Ireland,</hi> from tho≈øe Counties which were under the power of the Kings army, while in the meane time the hou≈øes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by their ordinances, declarations, &amp; ≈øollicitations to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London,</hi> &amp; the counties free from the terror of the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ≈øtill procuring not contemptible ayde and reliefe for the di≈øtre≈ø≈øes of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as the Lords and Commons have rea≈øon to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt this plot &amp; de≈øigne of a Ce≈ø≈øation of armes, as being treated and carryed on without their advi≈øe, ≈øo al≈øo, becau≈øe of the great prejudice which will thereby redound to the <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> Religion and the encouragement, and advancement which it will give to the practi≈øe of <hi>Popery,</hi> when the≈øe rebellious <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> ≈øhall by this agreement continue and ≈øet up with more freedome their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous wor≈øhip, their <hi>Popish</hi> ≈øuper≈øtitions, and <hi>Romish</hi> abominations in all the places of their command, to the di≈øhonoring of God, the grieving of all true <hi>Protestant</hi> hearts, the di≈øpi≈øing the Lawes of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and to the provoking of the wrath of a Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, as if both kingdomes had not ≈ømarted enough already for this ≈øin, of too much connyving at, and tolerating of <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian</hi> Idolatry, under pretext of Civill contracts and politick agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place they de≈øire it may be ob≈øerved that this Ce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation will prove di≈øhonorable to the publicke faith of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it will elude and make null the acts and ordinances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made for the forfeyting of Rebels Lands, at the pa≈ø≈øing of which acts it was repre≈øented that ≈øuch a cour≈øe would drive the Rebels to de≈øpayre, &amp; it prove ≈øo, but otherwi≈øe then was meant. For di≈øpayring of their force and courage they go about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us with their craft.</p>
                  <p>La≈øtly what ≈øhall become of the many poore exiled <hi>Protestants</hi> turned out of their e≈øtates by this rebellion, who mu≈øt now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue begging their bread, while the rebels ≈øhall enjoy their lands and hou≈øes, And who ≈øhall ≈øecure the re≈øt of the <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their owne courage, indu≈øtry, &amp; great charges hath kept their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, or by the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of our Armies have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtored, can there be any a≈ø≈øurance gotten from a perfidious enemy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53932:11"/>of a Ce≈ø≈øation, from butchery, and breach of agreement, when they ≈øhall ≈øee a fit time and opportunity.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe and many other con≈øiderations being well weighed, it will appeare evidently, that this de≈øigne of a Ce≈ø≈øation is a deepe plot laid by the Rebells, and really invented for their own ≈øafety and fal≈øely pretended to bee for the benefit of our Armies: And whereas the Lords and Commons have no certaine information, that the treaty is concluded, but are informed by ≈øeverall letters, that all the <hi>Protestants</hi> as well inhabitants as ≈øoldiors in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are re≈øolved to with≈øtand that proceeding, and to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the greate≈øt extremities, rather then have any ≈øort of peace with that generation, who have ≈øo cruelly, in time of peace, murthered many thou≈øands of our Countrey-men, and laboured to extirpe the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> from among≈øt them, ≈øo they doe believe, that the≈øe rumors of a Ce≈ø≈øation were fir≈øt contrived by the enemies of our Religion and peace, and by their practi≈øes the treaty was carried on with much ≈øubtility and ≈øollicitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ≈øtoppe the ≈øending of ≈øupplies from thence to our Armies, and for the cooling of the affections of tho≈øe who have already ≈øhewed their zeale to the weale of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes to defeate this their policy, and prevent the evills in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it, is to ≈øettle a cour≈øe whereby the army of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be at lea≈øt fenced again≈øt hunger and cold, for which purpo≈øe it is de≈øired, that all tho≈øe who are well affected to the <hi>Prote≈øtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> either in that or this kingdome. And all tho≈øe who by their adventures already made, have imbarked their particular intere≈øts with the publicke of that kingdome, and doe de≈øire a good returne of their engagements will joyne their endeavours for obviating of that nece≈ø≈øity, which may be made a ≈øtrong argument to enforce a de≈øtructive Ce≈ø≈øation of Armes, &amp; that they would nor through too much ≈øu≈øpition and jealou≈øie of it forbeare the providing of ≈øupplies, and ≈øo occa≈øion that inconvenience which they ought by all meanes to prevent, for by ≈øo doeing they will loo≈øe all their former paines and charges, and the withholding of provi≈øions will gaine credit to that calumny laid again≈øt this kingdome, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the armies of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by the continuing of ≈øupplies, the≈øe forces will bee encouraged to continue the warre, and ≈øo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p> And la≈øtly the Rebels ≈øeeing a≈ø≈øi≈øtance again≈øt them ≈øtill flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from hence mu≈øt needs be out of hope of pro≈øecuting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding this their de≈øigne, the cry of much <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> bloud, the great indigencie of many ruynate families, the danger of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion almo≈øt exiled out of that kingdome calls for this la≈øt act of piety, charity, ju≈øtice, and policy from us, which being re≈øolved on letters are to bee di≈øpatcht to the ≈øeverall partes of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to encourage the Commanders and ≈øouldiers upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid rea≈øons and a≈ø≈øurances, that they may not hearken to ≈øuch an unju≈øt and deceitfull coun≈øell, and as by their pro≈øecuting of the warre through Gods ble≈ø≈øing, they have ≈øucce≈ø≈øe fully re≈øi≈øted the Rebels cruelty, ≈øo they may upon this occa≈øion beware they be not over reached by their crafts.</p>
                  <p>All which the Lords and Commons doe earne≈øtly de≈øire may be ≈øeriou≈øly taken into heart by all the kingdome, and that from tho≈øe other encouragements mentioned at large, in the ordinance of the fourteenth of <hi>Iuly</hi> la≈øt, and ≈øuch as are now offered, a cour≈øe may be taken wherby ≈øuch a con≈øtant weekely contribution may be ≈øetled, as will ≈øupply the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> The meere nece≈ø≈øity of nature which may be more punctually and ≈øea≈øonably tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the ≈øeverall parts of that kingdome according to their re≈øpective wants, that ≈øo the benefit and honour of ≈øo pious a worke, happily begun, and ≈øucce≈ø≈øively hitherto carryed on may not be lo≈øt when ≈øo little remaynes to be done, And that the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a kingdome, the ree≈øtabli≈øhing of ≈øo many <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> Churches, the repo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing of ≈øo many thou≈øand Chri≈øtians unto their e≈øtates may not be de≈øerted and let fall to the ground for a little more paines and co≈øt.</p>
